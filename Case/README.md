# ESPLux Case

I'm probably getting a bit ahead of myself here. I have created a case for the final board to (hopefully) fit in. This is designed to work with the [Sick of Beige](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Sick_of_Beige_standard_PCB_sizes_v1.0) DP7043 spec. 

If it all doesn't fit, its OpenSCAD. I'll just change the numbers and make it one of the bigger sizes. 

The plan is to cut out each of the layers on my laser cutter (hence the CDR file there for the text)
