***I've changed my wifi settings and I can't get back into my ESPLux! What do I do?***

Simply press and hold the button on the ESPLux itself, while turning the unit on. When the unit has reset itself, it will turn the indicator lights on to show that it has finished. You can then go through the initial setup process to get connected to your new network.
